What is it? :

Btex (for 'Bottom TEXture') is a very lightweight addon for World Of Warcraft providing Background texture at the bottom of the screen and was created by Tiggy.

What can it do? :
-----------------
- Put a texture of your choice on the bottom of the screen via menu options (use /bx menu or /btex menu),
- Set height/width/transparency/position/colors/layer of your texture,
- Use any other TGA/BLP texture file or any other 'pack' of skin,
- Display a grid to setup your interface correctly,
- Modify the 3D rendering area with viewport function,
- Work in any resolution,
- Low memory usage & standalone addon (no libs or dependency are needed).

FAQ :
-----
How do I run menu config ? type "/bx Menu" or "/Btex menu" in the chat windows.
Why the download is so big ? it's because it contain many images.
How do i load custom skins? Copy TGA or BLP files to /interface/btex/skins/ directory, and use the "custom texture" options on the top dropdown menu. Write name file without the end "-1.tga".
Example:  for 'blabla' skin, you have 4 tga named blabla-1.tga, blabla-2.tga. Write 'blabla' in the custom name.
Do the skin support transparency ? yes. Via images files and via WOW API.
Can i use BLP file? Yes. use custom load skin, and do like with any other tga file.
