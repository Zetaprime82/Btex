- Use any other TGA/BLP texture file or any other 'pack' of skin,
- Display a grid to setup your interface correctly,
- Modify the 3D rendering area with viewport function,

When done, make 4 tga like this :
- image must be in RGB,
- Width and height must be a 512x256,
- Color depth must be 24-bit (8x8x8),
- 8-bit alpha channel must be present (thus making a 32 bit depth),

FAQ :
-----
How do I run menu config ? type "/bx Menu" or "/Btex menu" in the chat windows.
Why the download is so big ? it's because it contain many images.
How do i load custom skins? Copy TGA or BLP files to /interface/btex/skins/ directory, and use the "custom texture" options on the top dropdown menu. Write name file without the end "-1.tga".
Example:  for 'blabla' skin, you have 4 tga named blabla-1.tga, blabla-2.tga. Write 'blabla' in the custom name.
Do the skin support transparency ? yes. Via images files and via WOW API.
Can i use BLP file? Yes. use custom load skin, and do like with any other tga file.
